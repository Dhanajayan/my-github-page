				<h2>C Language</h2>
				<p>by&nbsp<span style="color: #9B59B0;">dhananjayan</span></p>
		<div class="content">		<p>C is a middle level programming language. It was developed by Dennis Richie and Ken thompson at AT & T Bell Laboratory. It isa sample text used to test the display of text on the screen 
C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
</p>
<p>8, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.</p>

<p>The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs have been written in C. The C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.</p>

<ul>	
   <li> Easy to learn</li>

<li>    Structured language</li>

<li>    It produces efficient programs.</li>

<li>    It can handle low-level activities.</li>

  <li>  It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Facts about C</h4>

  <p>  C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.

    C is a successor of B language which was introduced around 1970

    The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).

    The UNIX OS was totally written in C by 1973.

    Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.

    Most of the state-of-the-art softwares have been implemented using C.

    Today's most popular Linux OS and RBDMS MySQL have been written in C.</p>

<h4>Why to use C?</h4>
<p>
C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Operating Systems</li>

<li>    Language Compilers</li>

<li>    Assemblers</li>

<li>    Text Editors</li>

<li>    Print Spoolers</li>

<li>    Network Drivers</li>

<li>    Modern Programs</li>

<li>    Databases</li>

<li>    Language Interpreters</li>

<li>    Utilities</li>
</ul>


<h4>C Programs</h4>

<p>A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.</p>

<p>This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.</p>
